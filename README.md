Open Plant Pathology Notes

Open Plant Pathology accepts content to be posted to the website, https://www.openplantpathology.org/, that provide examples of teaching materials, reproducible research and other materials of interest to plant pathologists. To help ensure the quality of these materials, we ask that they be peer-reviewed by qualified members of the Open Plant Pathology community.
